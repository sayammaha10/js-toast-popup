This is a simple web application that demonstrates the use of toast notifications and pop-up notifications built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to display dynamic messages such as success, error, and invalid notifications, as well as trigger a smooth pop-up with a thank you message.

## Features
- **Toast Notifications**: Display success, error, and invalid messages with animation effects.
- **Pop-up Notification**: A centered, smooth transition pop-up with a thank you message.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the app, including buttons for triggering notifications and the pop-up.
- **CSS**: For styling the toast notifications, pop-up modal, and adding animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the interactivity, such as showing/hiding the pop-up and creating dynamic toast notifications.
